# GoogleAdwordsAPI
GoogleAdwordsAPI integration for PHP MVC frameworks or Pure PHP websites

#install

You must install composer at first.

I had developed this API for Yii framework.

But I am sure this can be used in all frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony and other composer based framework.

-Maybe you are developing on Pure PHP

1.Composer install 

Here are library link

https://github.com/googleads/googleads-php-lib/tree/master/examples/AdWords/v201710

Notes that google upgrade this library twice a year.

This is the detail of their schedule

2.You must indentify the location of adsapi_php.ini for authentication from google.

After that, you can manage campaign for website or application.

Maybe if you need to add more functions, I will follow you.
