# GoogleAdwordsAPI
GoogleAdwordsAPI integration for PHP MVC frameworks or Pure PHP websites

#install
You must install composer at first.
I had developed this API for Yii framework.
But I am sure this can be used in all frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony and other composer based framework.
-Maybe you are developing on Pure PHP

1.Composer install 

2.You must indentify the location of adsapi_php.ini for authentication from google.

After that, you can manage campaign for website or application.

Maybe if you need to add more functions, I will follow you.
